# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my [GitHub "Profile README"](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-your-profile-readme). It is the landing page when anyone navigates to my GitHub link.

### ðŸ’¬ About Me
I love to travel and spend time with my family, and in my free time, you can often find me playing board games with them or enjoying the outdoors at one of the beautiful 10,000+ lakes in Minnesota. 

I am currently a freelance Software Engineer training AI chatbots on various coding standards and practices. My previous professional experiences include working as a DevOps engineer in the release engineering organization. I was responsible for automating build and deployment pipelines, as well as improving infrastructure reliability. As an admin of my organization's GitLab instance, I managed monthly patches and upgrades, and handled user onboarding and offboarding. I contributed to automation tools that reduced developer overhead using technologies like Python, Shell, Docker, AWS, Artifactory, and GitLab CI/CD.

Other experiences include working as a Backend engineer where I was briefly contracted to implement a RESTful API in Java using Spring Boot and Postgres to enhance data accessibility to our production inventory accuracy data. This opportunity showcased my microservice and software development lifecycle skills by streamlining the process for stakeholders to manually intervene in falsely rejected inventory data. Similarly, I have technical background working as an Information Technology Support Specalist where I troubleshoot and solve hardware and software issues with individuals of various age and technical aptitude! It was an accomplishing opportunity where I leveraged my strong verbal and written communication skills.

I am open for opportunities and am excited to connect with like-minded professionals to explore potential collaboration, transferring not just my technical skills but also a spirit of dedication and curiosity!
