# Welcome! üëã I'm Andres
### I am a Software Engineer.

This is my portfolio where I version control my personal coding projects.

## üí¨ About Me
I love to travel and spend time with my family, and in my free time, you can find me playing board games or enjoying the outdoors with them at one of the beautiful 10,000+ lakes in Minnesota. 

I am a freelance Software Engineer training AI chatbots on various coding standards and practices. My previous experience include working as a DevOps engineer in the release engineering organization where I developed scripts to automate build, test, security, and deployment pipelines, improved infrastructure reliability, and managed my organization's GitLab instance.

Additional experiences include a Backend Engineer where I was contracted to implement a RESTful API to enhance data accessibility to our production inventory accuracy data. This opportunity showcased my microservice and software development skills by streamlining the process for stakeholders to manually intervene in falsely rejected inventory data.

Similarly, I have technical background as a Information Technology Support where I troubleshooted and solved hardware and software issues for individuals of various technical aptitude! It was an accomplishing opportunity that leveraged my strong verbal and written communication as well as troubleshooting skills.

I am currently open for full-time opportunities and am excited to connect with like-minded professionals to explore potential collaboration, transferring not just my technical skills but also a spirit of dedication and curiosity!
