# Welcome! üëã I'm Andres
### I am a Software Engineer

This is my nifty [GitHub "Profile README"](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-your-profile-readme) landing page.

## üí¨ About Me
I love to travel and spend time with my family, and in my free time, you can often find me playing board games with them or enjoying the outdoors at one of the beautiful 10,000+ lakes in Minnesota. 

I am a freelance Software Engineer training AI chatbots on various coding standards and practices. My previous experiences include working as a DevOps engineer in the release engineering organization. I was responsible for automating build and deployment pipelines, improving infrastructure reliability, and managing my organization's GitLab instance. I contributed to automation tools that reduced developer overhead using technologies like Ansible, AWS, Docker, GitLab C/CD, and Shell Scripting.

Additional experiences include a Backend Engineer where I was contracted to implement a RESTful API in Java using Spring Boot and Postgres to enhance data accessibility to our production inventory accuracy data. This opportunity showcased my microservice and software development skills by streamlining the process for stakeholders to manually intervene in falsely rejected inventory data. 

Similarly, I have technical background as a Information Technology Support where I troubleshoot and solve hardware and software issues for individuals of various age and technical aptitude! It was an accomplishing opportunity that leveraged my strong verbal and written communication skills.

I am currently open for full-time opportunities and am excited to connect with like-minded professionals to explore potential collaboration, transferring not just my technical skills but also a spirit of dedication and curiosity!
